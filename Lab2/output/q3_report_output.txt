=== Analysis Summary ===
The 2D heat diffusion simulation demonstrates good parallel scalability due to:
1. Regular grid structure with independent grid point updates
2. Predictable memory access patterns (stencil computation)
3. Low cache miss rate indicating excellent spatial locality
4. No race conditions - each thread writes to unique locations

Performance comparison:
- Static scheduling: Lowest overhead for uniform workload
- Dynamic scheduling: Slight overhead but flexible
- Guided scheduling: BEST PERFORMANCE - balances overhead and flexibility
- Cache-blocking: Further improves cache locality

Bottlenecks:
- Limited by cache bandwidth rather than computation
- Efficiency ~55-58% at 8 threads due to memory subsystem limits
- Not DRAM-bound - cache-dominated workload
